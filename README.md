A cross-platform Discord music bot with a clean interface, and that is easy to set up and run yourself!

## ⚠️ Check your Java Version and other requirements

This version of JMusicBot changes/updates various dependencies. To ensure your bot continues to function correctly, please note the following mandatory changes:

*   **Java 25 Minimum:** The bot now requires **Java 25 or higher**. 

*   **jdave/udpqueue:** You **must** have **glibc >= 2.38**. *If you are using Docker, this is already handled for you.*
*   **Privileged Gateway Intents:** You **must** enable the **Message Content Intent** in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    *   *Navigate to: Your Application > Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents > Toggle "Message Content Intent" to ON.*
    *   *Without this, the bot will not see your prefix commands (e.g. `!play`). Slash commands (`/play`) work without it.*

## Setup
Please see the [Setup Page](https://jmusicbot.com/setup) to run this bot yourself!

## Running Directly (Without Docker)

When running JMusicBot directly (not in Docker), make sure to pass these JVM flags:

**Linux / macOS / Windows (CMD):**
```bash
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dnogui=true --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -jar JMusicBot-0.7.0-All.jar
```

**Windows (PowerShell):** PowerShell treats `-D` as its own parameter. Quote each JVM option so they are passed to `java` correctly:
```powershell
java "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" "-Dnogui=true" "--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED" "-jar" ".\JMusicBot-0.7.0-All.jar"
```
Alternatively, use the stop-parsing token so the rest of the line is passed literally: `java --% -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dnogui=true ...`

`-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` ensures non-English characters (Cyrillic, Japanese, etc.) display correctly in Discord. On Windows or older JDKs, omitting it can cause mojibake in slash-command autocomplete and embeds.

Omit `-Dnogui=true` if you want the desktop GUI with the performance and health monitors; it can also be turned off permanently with `gui.enabled = false` in `config.txt`.

On Linux/macOS, [`scripts/run_jmusicbot.sh`](scripts/run_jmusicbot.sh) downloads the latest release jar, passes the required flags, and restarts the bot in a loop after the `shutdown` command.

### Linux System Requirements

**Important:** Your system **must have glibc version 2.38 or higher**. Failure to meet this requirement will result in errors when loading the jdave and udpqueue native libraries.

> **Note:** Ubuntu 24.04 "Noble" and Debian 13 "Trixie" already include a compatible glibc version out of the box.

You can check your glibc version with:
```bash
ldd --version
```

On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you may also need to install the following native audio library dependencies:

```bash
# Install required native library dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libopus0 libsodium23
```


If your version is below 2.38, you will need to upgrade your system or use a compatible runtime. (You can also use Docker, which is recommended.)

## Docker

JMusicBot can be run using Docker for easy deployment and management. Pre-built images are available from the GitHub Container Registry. The container is configured to run headless and automatically generate a default `config.txt` on first run.

### Quick Start

#### For Existing Users (Migrating from JAR)

If you already have a directory with your `config.txt`, `Playlists/` folder, and other bot files, either provide the path to that directory or run the container from within it:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name jmusicbot \
  -v "$(pwd):/musicbot" \
  ghcr.io/ragnarrok/jmusicbot:latest
```

This mounts your current directory as the musicbot volume, so the bot will use your existing configuration and playlists.

#### For New Users

1. **Create a directory for your bot and run the container:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/jmusicbot
   
   docker run --rm -it \
     --name jmusicbot \
     -v "/path/to/musicbot:/musicbot" \
     ghcr.io/ragnarrok/jmusicbot:latest
   ```

2. **First Run:**
   - On first run, if the mounted directory is empty, the bot will automatically generate a default `config.txt` file.
   - Edit `/path/to/musicbot/config.txt` on your host and add your Discord bot token.
   - Run the container again.

#### Using Docker Compose (Optional)

If you prefer docker-compose, copy the example compose file and update the volume path:

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml and update the volume path
docker compose up -d
```

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  jmusicbot:
    image: ghcr.io/ragnarrok/jmusicbot:latest
    container_name: jmusicbot
    volumes:
      - /path/to/musicbot:/musicbot
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Check the [Docker Compose Example](docker-compose.example.yml) for more details.

### Important Notes

- **Config Persistence:** The `/musicbot` volume **must** be mounted for your configuration to persist. The bot reads and writes `config.txt` from `/musicbot` (the container's working directory).
- **First Run:** If `config.txt` doesn't exist, the bot will generate a default one automatically. You'll need to edit it with your bot token before the bot can start.
- **Image Tags:** 
  - Use `ghcr.io/ragnarrok/jmusicbot:latest` for the latest build from the master branch
  - Use `ghcr.io/ragnarrok/jmusicbot:0.7.0` (replace with actual version) to pin a specific release version
  - Every build is also tagged `sha-<commit>`. Maintainers can publish `preview-<branch>` images for any ref by running the "Publish Preview Image" workflow manually
  - **Recommendation:** For production, pin your image tag rather than using `latest`
- **File Permissions:** The container runs as the non-root user `jmusicbot` (UID 10001). Make sure the mounted directory is writable by that UID (`chown 10001:10001 /path/to/musicbot`), or set `user:` in your compose file to your own UID/GID.
- **JAVA_OPTS:** The container uses ZGC and AlwaysPreTouch by default. Set `JAVA_OPTS` to add heap limits (e.g. `-Xms256m -Xmx512m`) or other flags. See [Performance Tuning](#performance-tuning) for details.

## Performance Tuning

For optimal audio quality with minimal stuttering, the following JVM and configuration options are recommended.

### JVM Flags (Recommended)

The bot works best with ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) which provides sub-millisecond pause times:

```bash
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \
     -XX:+UseZGC \
     -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch \
     -Dnogui=true \
     --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED \
     -jar JMusicBot-*.jar
```

**Flag explanations:**
- `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`: Ensures non-English characters display correctly in Discord (required on Windows or older JDKs)
- `-XX:+UseZGC`: Sub-millisecond GC pauses (generational mode is the default since JDK 23)
- `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`: Pre-allocates memory at startup to avoid page faults
- `-Xms` / `-Xmx`: Optional; set heap size if you want to limit or fix memory (e.g. `-Xms256m -Xmx512m`)

The Docker image uses ZGC and AlwaysPreTouch by default. Set `JAVA_OPTS` to add heap limits or override:
```yaml
environment:
  - JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch
```

### Audio Buffer Configuration

The bot includes configurable audio buffers that protect against GC pauses. These can be tuned in `config.txt`:

```hocon
performance {
  # NAS buffer duration in ms (protects against JVM pauses up to this duration)
  nasBufferMs = 800
  
  # Lavaplayer frame buffer duration in ms (amount of decoded audio to buffer)
  frameBufferMs = 2000
}
```

Higher values provide more protection against stuttering but add latency. The defaults (800ms NAS, 2000ms frame buffer) should work well for most setups.

## Live Stream Persistence

Internet radio streams (Azuracast, Icecast, Shoutcast, etc.) occasionally drop: the server restarts, the connection is reset, or the stream stalls and stops sending data. By default the bot treats that like the end of a track and moves on, so the stream has to be queued again by hand.

Turn on stream persistence in `config.txt` and the bot will reconnect to the same stream automatically instead:

```hocon
playback {
  streams {
    # Reconnect live streams that stop unexpectedly
    persist = true

    # Wait before the first reconnect attempt; doubles after each consecutive failure
    reconnectDelaySeconds = 5
    reconnectMaxDelaySeconds = 60

    # Consecutive failed attempts before giving up (0 = retry forever)
    reconnectMaxAttempts = 0
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- Only live streams (tracks with no known duration) are affected. Normal songs, playlists and local files behave exactly as before.
- A stream is reconnected when it ends on its own, fails to load, or stalls for longer than lavaplayer's stuck threshold (10 seconds). The now-playing message is kept while the bot reconnects.
- `stop`, `skip`, `forceskip`, `skipto` and playing something else never trigger a reconnect. Queuing another track while a reconnect is pending cancels the reconnect.
- Each consecutive failure doubles the wait (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 60s, 60s, ...). The counter resets once the stream has played for 30 seconds, so a brief blip always retries quickly.
- Combine with `voice.stayInChannel = true` if you want the bot to stay in the voice channel even when it gives up after `reconnectMaxAttempts`.

## Proxy Configuration

JMusicBot supports granular proxy configuration, allowing you to route specific components through a proxy while letting others connect directly. This is useful when you need to proxy audio traffic (e.g., to bypass regional restrictions) without affecting Discord API communication.

### Configuration

Add the following to your `config.txt`:

```hocon
proxy {
  # Proxy server hostname and port
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  port = 8080
  
  # Enable proxy for specific components
  lavaplayer = true   # Audio source requests (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)
  jda = false         # Discord API traffic
  github = false      # Version check requests
}
```

### Common Use Cases

**Route only audio traffic through proxy** (most common):
```hocon
proxy {
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  port = 18080
  lavaplayer = true
  jda = false
  github = false
}
```

**Route all traffic through proxy**:
```hocon
proxy {
  host = "proxy.example.com"
  port = 8080
  lavaplayer = true
  jda = true
  github = true
}
```

### Notes

- Leave `host` empty or `port` as 0 to disable proxy entirely
- Each component can be independently enabled/disabled
- HTTP proxies are supported (SOCKS proxies are not currently supported)

## Development Workflow

This project follows a **trunk-based development** workflow. The `master` branch is always releasable, and all work happens in short-lived branches:

- **`feature/<slug>`** - New features (e.g., `feature/new-player-ui`)
- **`fix/<slug>`** - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/youtube-oauth`)
- **`chore/<slug>`** - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-deps`)
- **`deps/<slug>`** - Dependency experiments (e.g., `deps/youtube-source-pr195`)
- **`release/<version>`** - Release stabilization (optional, e.g., `release/0.7.1`)

Branch names are automatically validated by CI to ensure consistency (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens only; `feat/` is not accepted, use `feature/`). For detailed information about the development workflow, branch naming rules, and best practices, see [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md). An overview of the code structure lives in [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Every code push to `master` is tested and, if green, automatically released: the patch version is bumped, a `vX.Y.Z` tag and GitHub release with the JAR are created, and a matching Docker image is published. Bump the minor or major version in `pom.xml` yourself when a change warrants it.

To build from source you need JDK 25+ and Maven 3.9+:

```bash
mvn verify
```

The runnable jar is written to `target/JMusicBot-<version>-All.jar`.
